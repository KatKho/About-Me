    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <img src="img/99D11F11-068B-4894-9CF8-B3CCEC54BA3E.JPG">
    <p>Hi everyone! I was born and raised in Moscow, Russia, and moved to the US six years ago. I've always had a passion for traveling and have been fortunate enough to visit 17 states and 27 countries so far, but there's still so much more to see.</p>
    <p>Aside from my love for exploring new places, I've also nurtured a keen interest in photography and drawing. At one point in my life, I even worked as a concert photographer. Watercolor painting is my preferred medium, and I aim to create at least one painting every two weeks.</p>
    <p>When I'm not immersed in the creative world, I enjoy playing video games, engaging in outdoor activities (I recently bought a paddleboard this summer!), and practicing yoga. I find these hobbies to be both relaxing and invigorating.</p>
